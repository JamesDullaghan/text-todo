1. Log into twilio.com and go to the Numbers page in the Console.
2. Click on your SMS-enabled phone number.
3. Find the Messaging section. The default “CONFIGURE WITH” is what you’ll need: "Webhooks/TwiML."
4. In the “A MESSAGE COMES IN” section, select "Webhook" and paste in the URL you want to use (don’t forget the /sms-quickstart endpoint!). Set the HTTP verb to GET. Save your number settings.
